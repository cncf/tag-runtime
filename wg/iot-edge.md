# IoT Edge Working Group Charter

## Mission Statement

IoT Edge Working group focuses on topics of running workloads in edge computing environments and providing support for connecting far-edge devices. Evolving from the Kubernetes IoT Edge working group, it extends the mission to include a wider set of projects. Working group's mission is to enable widespread and successful use of cloud-native technologies for IoT and Edge computing use cases. It will engage in the following activities:

- **Educate and inform** users with unbiased information regarding edge computing related CNCF projects
- **Strengthen the ecosystem** by fostering better collaboration between existing projects
- **Curate best practices** related to the edge computing systems that are effective and actionable.
- Identify gaps in the landscape and **attract new projects** to the ecosystem.
- **Provide technical support** to users trying to implement edge computing systems

## Scope
The working group is interested in all topics related to building edge computing solutions, including:

- Developing and adjusting **infrastructure for edge deployments**. As an extension to the cloud, edge computing infrastructure needs modifications to meet edge conditions. Resource constraints and intermittent network connectivity are commonly considered topics in Edge computing.
- Development and configuration of **edge-specific workloads**. How do we write and deploy our workloads to edge environments? Topics like multi-architecture builds, multi-cluster deployments, access to system resources and GitOps are usually discussed in this regard.
- Cloud-native **DevOps practices for edge** environments. How do we operate our workloads in edge deployment scenarios? Typical DevOps and Observability topics need to be adjusted to edge computing environments.

## Deliverables
The working group will build collaboration, knowledge, and projects in the edge computing space, including:

- **Publications, presentations and whitepapers** on interesting topics - the group will try to stay ahead of the current technology trends and provide material on the latest innovative topics in the space.
- **Example architectures and demos** - provide well documented use cases using existing projects and demos that can be used as starting point of future projects.
- **Standards, tests and certifications** - the group will investigate if it is possible to certify solutions in well defined domains against known criteriums.
- **Metrics** - provide guidelines for project planning in terms of resource usage.
- **Ecosystem updates** - give updates about the landscape of cloud native projects on the edge at conferences, in publications, and to the Runtime TAG.

## Current CNCF Edge-centric projects
The following is a list of well-known CNCF projects used in edge-computing solutions:
